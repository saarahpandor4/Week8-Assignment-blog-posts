ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

I managed to complete the normal requirements; displaying all posts on the page and sorting them asc-desc order, SQL schema for a posts and comments table, created a delete button on the comments table.
I wanted to also have a delete button for my posts however I didnt have enough time to complete that. I also found styling difficult this time round. I initially wanted to have my posts displayed in blocks like I did on my last weeks assignments and also have my forms styled like last weeks however I couldnt quiet figure out how to do it so I left it how it was. I also found displaying the pictures a little hard but i did come accross a doc on next.js which helped a little bit with displaying my pictures with 'grid'. If I had more time I would have played around more with the styling elements and also tried the strecth goals!
